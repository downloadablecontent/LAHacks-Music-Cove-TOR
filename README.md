A TOR hidden service of [LAHacks-Music-Cove](https://github.com/PaddingProductions/LAHacks-Music-Cove) for more added privacy. If accessed from TOR, the server will not know your IP address. If accessed from TOR, visiting the TOR site, there will be even more benefits, such as being unblockable by ISPs or nation states. Also, no one will no where the server is being ran from.

When the dependencies are installed (see `replit.nix`) and `main.sh` is ran, a `tor/hidden_service` folder will be made with the onion url of the site.

Deployed on Replit.
